# AI Web Crawler

## Overview
AI Web Crawler is a web scraping tool built with Python and Streamlit, completely **written by AI**. It extracts and filters links from single or multiple URLs and handles dynamic content with Selenium. This project was developed with the help of AI.

## Features
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Uses Selenium for pages with dynamic content.
- **Custom Filters**: Include or exclude links based on file types and keywords.
- **Bulk URL Handling**: Process URLs from direct input or uploaded CSV/TXT files.
- **Download Options**: Save results in CSV or TXT formats, with options for ZIP files per domain.
- **Rate Limiting**: Set a delay between requests to avoid overwhelming servers.
- **Authentication**: Supports basic authentication.
